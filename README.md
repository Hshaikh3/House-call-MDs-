<h1>House Call MDs – IT Help Desk & Security Experience</h1>
<h2>Description</h2> 
This experience reflects my work at <a href="https://housecallsmds.com/" target="_blank">House Call MDs</a>, a healthcare organization that provides in-home and virtual medical services. The company operates in a HIPAA-regulated environment, so protecting patient data and keeping systems secure is important. I work on a very small IT team of two people, so we are the first point of contact for all IT-related issues. This includes technical support, security issues, network problems, and hardware and software troubleshooting. We support multiple entities under House Call MDs, including Florida Wound and Healing and Pure Envy Med Spa, and manage their users, systems, and daily IT needs. In this role, I support both IT operations and security tasks by helping users, managing access, and responding to issues as they come up. This position has given me hands-on experience with identity management, endpoint security, phishing response, and working in a real healthcare IT environment.</h2>
